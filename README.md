# Binary Trees Project
This project is a collaboration between Aalaa Fahim and Reham Saeed, cohort 19 students of ALX Software Engineering using the Holberton School curriculum. It explores the concepts of binary trees, their variations, and their applications.

Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, providing a way to store and organize data hierarchically. This README file will guide you through the key concepts and differences between binary trees and binary search trees, the time complexity benefits, and the various types of binary trees and essential operations on them.
